# E-Commerce Platform: Design

## Objectives
1. Build a scalable e-commerce platform using a microservices architecture.
2. Address key functionalities such as inventory management, order processing, and payment integration.

## Core Features
- **Microservices:** Product catalog, shopping cart, order processing, and payment handling.
- **Additional Support:** Recommendations, notifications, and analytics.

## Architectural Principles
- **Service Autonomy:** Each microservice will maintain its own database to ensure loose coupling and independent scalability.
- **Event-Driven Architecture:** Utilize Kafka for handling events related to orders, inventory, and payments to ensure real-time processing and communication.
- **Security:** Implement robust authentication mechanisms and ensure secure communications across all services.

## Technology Stack
- **Backend:** Golang for building microservices.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for reliable and scalable data storage.
- **Containerization:** Kubernetes for orchestrating containerized applications.
