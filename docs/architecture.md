# Architecture

## Overview
The platform is built using a microservices architecture to ensure modularity, scalability, and fault isolation. This approach allows each service to be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

### Components
1. **API Gateway**: Acts as a centralized entry point for all client requests, handling routing, authentication, and rate limiting.
2. **Microservices**:
   - **Product Service**: Responsible for managing product information, including creation, updates, and retrieval of product data.
   - **Cart Service**: Handles user shopping cart operations, such as adding, updating, and removing items from the cart.
   - **Order Service**: Manages the order processing workflow, including order creation, validation, and payment processing.
   - **Payment Service**: Integrates with third-party payment providers to handle payment transactions securely and efficiently.

### Communication
- **Synchronous Communication**: Utilizes APIs for critical operations that require immediate responses, ensuring real-time interaction between services.
- **Asynchronous Communication**: Employs Kafka for non-critical workflows, such as logging, to improve system resilience and decouple services.

### Deployment
- **Containerization**: Docker is used to package services into containers, ensuring consistency across different environments and simplifying deployment.
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes is employed to manage containerized services, providing automated scaling, load balancing, and fault tolerance.

## Rationale
- **Microservices over Monolith**: Choosing a microservices architecture allows for the independent development, deployment, and scaling of services, enhancing flexibility and maintainability.
- **Database per Service**: Each microservice has its own database, which prevents cross-service coupling, improves scalability, and ensures data encapsulation.
